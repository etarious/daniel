        <h1>Tags and their types</h1>
        <p>
            <i><small>Before I go any further, let me tell you of the different types of tags</small></i><br>
            HTML works with tags "<" and ">", all the elements are created with tags. and there are different types of tags, which are;<br />
            <ul>
                <li>opened tags</li>
                <li>closed tags</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <hr>
        <div>
            <h3>Opened Tags:</h3>
            <p>
                <!-- View this part on the browser to better understand what I'm saying... -->
                These are tags that needs to be closed when opened, for example the "&lthtml&gt" tag at the beginning of file just after the doctype declaration is an opened tag. If you observe it was opened as written above as "&lthtml&gt", and at the end of this file you can it closing as this "&lt/html&gt".
            </p>
            <h3>Closed Tags:</h3>
            <p>These are tags that does not need a closing tag, they are self closed. a clear example is the "&ltbr&gt" element, which is sometimes written as "&ltbr /&gt".</p>

            <h3>Nesting</h3>
            Elements can be written inside other elements, and this is called nesting. <br>
            As you go through this notes on you VS code, you can realize that I put some tags and elements inside some other elements.

        <h3>
            The html tag
        </h3>
        <p>
            Looking at the HTML tag just below the doctype declaration, you can observe everyother thing was written inside it, and it consists of 2 sub elements, which are the head element and the body element. <br>
            The head elements consists data that are meant for the browser and not for the user, the head element holds some other important elements like the meta tags, title tags, and so on. While anything youe write inside the body element displays on the screen of the browser.
